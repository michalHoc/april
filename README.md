# April

This is a project for April robot.

The April robot is an autonomous robot for visual navigation in an unknown region.
The robot combines advantages of both Arduino Nano and Orange Pi Zero Plus 2 (OPiZ).
The visual sensor for the robot represents a Stereo Web Camera (Konig) that contains also
a microphone. The loudspeaker is used for audio output. The pan-tilt mechanism consists of
two servo motors. Besides the servo motors, there are two DC motors used for movement of the robot
around the space. Rechargable batteries (Li-Pol, 2S) are used as a power supply for OPiZ, Arduino 
and motion system.
With this configuration the robot is able to fulfill remote surveillance and telepresence tasks.
For 3D virtual reality the Google Cardboard with Smartphone (Samsung S4, or better) is used.

The robot can be programmed via SSH remote access.
The primary purpose of the project is to deliver low cost, DIY hardware platform for software development.
